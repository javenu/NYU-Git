# 3D Environment

Demo of an interactive room based on Unity's [Create with VR](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-vr) tutorial

This demo includes:

 - 3D Assets
 - First Person camera
 - Boundaries: walls and front door have colliders
 - Animations: door opening / closing, clock on the wall
 - UI: welcome home sign on the door
 - Cosmetic elements: music from radio, fire in the fireplace, video on the TV
 - Interactibles: tablet and apples, etc

# Instructions
Use arrows and WASD to move around the room. To grab an interactible, make sure its in the center of the screen and press E on the keyboard. Tip: The tablet or water pot are the easiest items to grab. Smaller items can be difficult to grab as they are smaller and its not obvious what collider the ray is interacting with. The front door is not meant to open all the way as that would require setting boundaries around the entire landscape.
