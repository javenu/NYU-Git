# 3D Environment

Unity demo of an interactive room based on the [Create with VR](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-vr) tutorial

This demo includes:

 - 3D Assets
 - First Person camera
 - Boundaries: walls and front door have colliders
 - Animations: door opening / closing, clock on the wall
 - UI: welcome home sign on the door
 - Cosmetic elements: music from radio, fire in the fireplace, video on the TV
 - Interactibles: table and apples, etc

# Instructions
To grab an interactible, make sure its in the center of the screen and press E on the keyboard
It can be difficult to grab items as they are smaller and its not obvious what the ray is interacting with.
The front door is not meant to open all the way as that would require create boundaries on the landscape
